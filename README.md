# 📊 Customer Support Analysis

An end-to-end **Customer Support Analytics** project using **Python, SQL, and Power BI** to analyze customer tickets, support teams, response performance, and key customer-service metrics.

The project combines **data analysis, SQL querying, Python-based data exploration, and an interactive Power BI dashboard** to generate meaningful insights from customer support data.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer support teams handle a large number of customer tickets every day. Analyzing these tickets helps organizations understand:

* How many support tickets are being received
* How quickly tickets are resolved
* Which teams handle the highest workload
* Which issues occur most frequently
* How customer support performance changes over time
* Where improvements can be made in the support process

This project analyzes customer support data and presents the findings through **Python analysis, SQL queries, and a Power BI dashboard**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

* Analyze customer support ticket data
* Understand ticket volume and trends
* Analyze support team performance
* Measure response and resolution performance
* Identify common customer issues
* Perform data cleaning and transformation
* Use SQL for business-oriented analysis
* Create meaningful KPIs
* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard
* Generate actionable business insights

# 🐍 Python Data Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook is used for exploring and analyzing the customer support dataset.

### Key activities

* Data loading
* Data inspection
* Data cleaning
* Missing-value analysis
* Data type conversion
* Feature exploration
* Statistical analysis
* Trend analysis
* Visualization

Example libraries used:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

---

# 🗄️ SQL Analysis

SQL is used to perform business-oriented analysis on the customer support data.

The SQL analysis focuses on questions such as:

* How many tickets are generated?
* Which support teams handle the most tickets?
* What are the most common ticket categories?
* Which teams have higher workloads?
* How are tickets distributed across different categories?
* What trends can be identified from ticket data?

Example:

```sql
SELECT
    team,
    COUNT(*) AS total_tickets
FROM tickets
GROUP BY team
ORDER BY total_tickets DESC;
```

---

# 📊 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** was developed to provide a clear overview of customer support performance.

### Dashboard Features

* Total Tickets
* Support KPIs
* Ticket trends
* Team performance
* Ticket distribution
* Category analysis
* Customer support insights
* Interactive filtering

The dashboard allows users to interact with the data and analyze customer-support performance from different perspectives.

---
